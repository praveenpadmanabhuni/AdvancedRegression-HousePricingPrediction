## General Information
This project was done as an assignment for Executive PG Programme in Machine Learning, Upgrad and IIITB
The aim is to identify significant features/variables for house pricing prediction.
The data contains the information about various significant variable or factors as part of Data sheet and optimal Lambdas for Ridge and Lasso.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
### For Ridge Regression Model at Lambda = 1 Predicted and Actual Values are proprtionately distributed
### For Lasso Regression Model at Lambda = 0.001 Predicted and Actual Values are proprtionately distributed

### And below are some significant Variables
1. OverallQual
2. GrLivArea
3. GarageArea
4. Neighborhood
5. GarageCars
6. YearBuilt
